I'd love it if you'd pray with me. It's a super important thing and it's good for you too :)

This is where I keep an up-to-date list of my prayer requests. Some things are general and some more specific. If you've got any questions, why not send me an email: timkaemmerer@gmail.com

*****************************

 - That God would work in my heart to make me more like Christ
 - Pray that He would give me understanding and skill in learning the things I need to do the work here.
 - For provision financially. I'm currently planning on taking a couple trips soon (including going back home for Christmas). Also, in case you didn't know, [I'm praying about starting a bible college in Guadalajara.]({{ root_url }}/blog/2012/10/21/praying-for-guadalajara/)
 - Please pray for the [Bible College](http://ccbcmexico.com/), for the students and teachers that the Lord would work in them a ton and use them for His glory.
