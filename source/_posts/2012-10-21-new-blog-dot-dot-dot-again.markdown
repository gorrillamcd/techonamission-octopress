So, I've made a new blog again. I know, I can't stay content with the same blog, but I think this one will stay for a while. The reason for the change? I wanted a free platform to blog on and tried tumblr and wordpress.com, but was sorely missing the ability to customize every aspect about my blog. Also, I've been using Markdown a lot lately and wanted to be able to use that (tumblr allows it, wordpress.com does not). For the curious, [here's a page explaining the basics markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).

Then I came across [this blog post on pacbard.tk](http://www.pacbard.tk/blog/2012/10/09/how-to-blog-like-a-scrooge/) and realized it was better than what I was wanting. In the post, the author describes how he brought together various free platforms to make a fully functioning blog backed by a CDN and with a free domain name! Since I wasn't familiar with all the systems used to make it happen, it required a bit of research on my part, but here it is. My new blog is hosted on the internet completely free and fully customizable. It should handle any traffic I get, since I don't get that much traffic anyways. If you don't understand a word I just said, basically I put together a blog for free much like you can put together a light meal from all the samples at Costco/Sam's Club!
