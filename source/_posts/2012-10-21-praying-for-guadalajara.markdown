So, if you don't live at the [Bible College](http://ccbcmexico.com/), you might not know it but I've been praying to see if it's the Lord's will that I go to Guadalajara to start an extension campus of the Bible College in Ensenada. Here's how it all came about.

Justin (a friend of mine and now graduated student) and I were praying about a year ago for what the Lord might want us to do after we finished at the Bible College. I'm not a student at the Bible College, in case anyone thought otherwise ([Here's a synopsis of what I do at the bible college](/about/index.html)). {"We decided that since the Lord can do anything, it'd be good to pray for something crazy"} and beyond our own abilities. So we prayed that if the Lord wanted, He would lead us to open a bible college elsewhere in Mexico. There was a map of Mexico in the office where we were at, so we randomly picked a place in Mexico and picked Jalisco. Guadalajara is the capital of the state of Jalisco.

It might sound weird, but we started praying off and on that the Lord would do His will with that. Justin graduated and is now in the army. However this summer, I was able to go on a missions trip to a pastor's conference in Queretaro (close to Mexico City). We drove the school's van from Ensenada all the way there, stopping at various churches along the way. While we were stopped in Guadalajara, I was able to talk to the pastor of the church there and, to make a long story short, left there praying all the more that God would do something awesome through me in Guadalajara.

Now, the plan is to continue praying and finish various things here at the Bible College. God seems to be providing the people to go with me (since I'd like to bring some of the graduates from here when I go). I'm working on getting with a Missions Agency and getting everything that's needed to prepare. I don't know yet when I'd go (probably a year from now), but the Lord does! If God is leading you to support me in missions, [check out how on the donate page](/donate/index.html).
