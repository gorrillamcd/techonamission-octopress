If the Lord is moving you to support me being a missionary, there are a couple ways you can do that.

One way is via Paypal. Just click the button below for that:<br />
<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick">
<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="ZDZG37XFFZQ66">
<input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!">

</form>

I'm in the process of getting with a missions agency which will help provide accountability and let you guys get a tax-deduction! Until I'm accepted with them though, you can donate via check (made out to Timothy Kaemmerer). Email me for the mailing address if you need it: timkaemmerer "at" gmail.com
