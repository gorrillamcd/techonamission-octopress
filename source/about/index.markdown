My name's Timothy Kaemmerer. I'm a missionary at Calvary Chapel Bible College in Ensenada, Mexico. A lot of times, people ask me what I'm doing in Mexico, so here's what God is doing in Mexico (through me):

 - I serve as the Systems Admin for CCBC Mexico
 - That means that I maintain the network, computers, our server, and am generally in charge of technology stuff
 - It also means I implement new tech-related projects and improvements.
 - I provide tech-support for the students and staff at the Bible College
 - I don't do all of this alone, but have a couple students that help me during the semester.
 - God is good. To him be all the glory!

Much of my time is spent maintaining what we have, but I also do various tech-related projects for the school:

 - **Currently:** I am working on building a web application called [Armory](https://gorrillamcd.github.com/Armory) that will be used to make our classes available online. If you're a web developer and would like to help, [the project is open-source on github](https://github.com/gorrillamcd/Armory)
 - **Currently:** We're working on making a manual for the IT department at the school so that, no matter who God brings to help in this area, they can have a running start and not be completely in the dark about what all these cables go to!
 - **Pending:** Some time at the end of 2012 or the beginning of 2013, we'll be implementing a wireless backhaul to provide DSL to the bible college. I'm super excited about this project and will post details when we start.
 - **Pending:** Make a new firewall using PFSense. This will be an improvement on our current firewall system and will help save money by condensing multiple services on to one computer, rather than multiple computers like we have now.
 - Implement Cellphone-Signal Amplifier. One building now has a moderate amount of signal as opposed to none. Since we're in a valley with normally no signal, this is a huge blessing. Praise the Lord!
 - Implement Web Cache and Optimize internet connection. Since we have satellite internet, we have a limited amount of bandwidth per day. Over the course of the first 2 years that I've been here, we made several improvements to the satellite installation (re-aligning it, replacing cables, grounding it properly) and also implemented a web cache which helps to save bandwidth.

If you knew me before I became a missionary, you know that I didn't know any of this stuff before I came (not even what an IP address is). **God deserves all the glory** for giving me both the will to learn and to capacity to do it.
